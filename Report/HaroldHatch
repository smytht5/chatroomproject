To complete all the project requirements:
I coded the client that allowed for:
  connection to the server
  create an account on the server
  log into an account on the server
  join a group chat on the server
  send and receive messages from a group chat on the server
  send and receive direct messages from a user on the server
I developed the login in screen, that allowed for rowan students/faculty to join via google sign in
I developed that dashboard page that allowed a user to choose a room to enter.
I designed and coded the main chat room screen that includes, all views and methods associated with the screen.
Lastly, I wrote about half of every document that needed to be turned in (Project Specification, Design Document, etc.)
