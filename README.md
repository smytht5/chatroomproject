The Rowan Chat Room aims to connect users on Rowan University's campus.

Users are able to communicate in various chat rooms determined by administrators, including rooms focused around 
various halls and current events.

Users also have the option to change their nickname, and the option to send direct messages.

Login and authentication is done via Google and the Rowan CAS.

Join chat rooms easily and find like-minded users to meet with, share study tips, organize events, and more!
